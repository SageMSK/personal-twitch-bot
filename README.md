# Personal Twitch Bot with mIRC

Small custom Twitch bot that extends from existing Twitch bots for a custom mIRC.
Separate the main bot that handles the default setting and commands and create this bot to handle minor commands. I don't want to clutter and stuff too much commands in the default twitch bots, get confused and/or lose track. This bot is for the custom fun and personal info commands such as future computer specs, addition social medias, small games and fun commands. Think personal assistant/intern.

Able to create custom commands for separate use from existing bot's purpose. More commands will be added when needed or asked.

# Current commands (for now)
** All commands should start with '!' **

- commands
- banmebitch
- bot
- dice
- roulette
- slapme
- time
- twitter

** Broadcaster must have partnership! **

- strictmode
- strictmode off

# Custom Notification for Subscription
** Broadcaster must have partnership! **
Bot will write a comment/message in chat to welcome and greet re-subs.
Useful in case TwitchAlerts or similar programs are having issues and can't track everyone in time. (This can be turned off.);
